# Isaac Sim as the second simulator tier — plan

2026-08-21 (night). Adrián's question: can we deploy Isaac Sim with the G1 and our map on the
lab station, for better realism? Feasibility checked: **yes** — driver 610.43 on 2× RTX 3090,
Ubuntu 22.04, docker with NVIDIA CDI runtime already configured, 1.2 TB free. The
`nvcr.io/nvidia/isaac-sim:4.2.0` container pulls without NGC auth (download running).

## Doctrine: two simulators, two roles — never mixed

| | Gazebo twin (existing) | Isaac Sim (new) |
|---|---|---|
| Role | **statistically calibrated** cheap runs (35 s), regression + replay validation | **structural realism**: material-aware RTX lidar, path-traced camera, articulated gait |
| Fidelity kind | matched to the REAL robot's measured statistics (c0_std, laser_noise…) | physically plausible, but its gait policy ≠ Unitree firmware — declared |
| What it can do that the other cannot | reproduce our calibrated noise contract; instant | glass that transmits, lights that switch, a body that actually walks |
| Substrate discipline | REPRODUCIBILITY.md: per-substrate baselines, results never compared across simulators | same rule from day one |

The Isaac tier exists for exactly the three walls we hit this month: **W1 physics** (tinted
glass as a transmissive material seen by a raytraced lidar), **W2/W3 illumination** (scene
lights on/off with a camera that actually darkens — the degradation model becomes testable in
sim), and **gait realism** (the effective-noise layer G1_SIM_GAIT approximates what Isaac can
produce structurally).

## Phases (background project — does NOT touch Thursday)

- **P0 — install** (running): container pulled; first boot headless + WebRTC streaming check;
  `nvidia.com/gpu` CDI passthrough.
- **P1 — G1 asset**: Unitree G1 USD (official assets / Isaac Lab). Sanity: spawn + joint
  articulation. Locomotion: Isaac Lab velocity policy for G1 (pretrained if available;
  otherwise train on the 3090s — days, acceptable). DECLARED: policy gait ≠ firmware gait.
- **P2 — the office in USD**: generate walls/floor/door from the SAME map data that built
  `lab.world` (same frame as the real robot → same waypoints, zero translation — the trick
  that made the Gazebo twin comparable). Tinted-glass panel as a transmissive material at its
  real pose.
- **P3 — bridge**: Isaac ROS2 bridge → publish /scan (RTX lidar), /odom, subscribe /cmd_vel →
  the EXISTING rosbridge websocket + `g1_sim_adapter.py` connect unchanged. The whole harness
  (goto, dataset, bitácora, replay) works day one.
- **P4 — experiments**: glass angular signature vs the real 21-Aug tandas; light-switch W2/W3
  episodes; gait-induced scan statistics vs the real IMU/scan numbers (the same table
  `compara_marcha.py` prints).

## Honest limits, stated up front

Isaac's G1 walks with OUR policy, not Unitree's controller — its gait signature will differ
from the real robot's just like the rigid twin does, only less. RTX lidar glass behaviour is a
material model, not measured IR optics of THIS tinted film. Isaac results therefore feed
DESIGN and staging rehearsal, not the calibrated claims the Gazebo twin backs. Both stay.
